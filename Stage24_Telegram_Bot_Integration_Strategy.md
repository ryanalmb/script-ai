**Testing Scope:** Complete user journeys from Telegram interface through backend services to final outcomes

**Campaign Creation Workflow Testing:** Comprehensive testing of the complete campaign creation process including user authentication, campaign configuration, backend service integration validation, real-time update verification, and campaign execution confirmation. The testing validates that all backend services respond correctly and that the Telegram interface provides appropriate feedback throughout the process.

**Multi-Service Operation Validation:** Testing of complex operations that involve multiple backend services working in coordination. This includes validation of session management, connection pool operations, campaign orchestration, and analytics integration. The testing ensures that service dependencies are properly managed and that failures in one service don't cascade to others.

**LLM Service Integration Testing:** Validation of natural language processing capabilities, content generation accuracy, and context awareness. Testing includes command interpretation accuracy, response quality, and learning system effectiveness.

**State Management Testing:** Comprehensive testing of state persistence across sessions, operation resumption after interruptions, and cross-device synchronization. The testing validates that user context is maintained correctly and that state corruption is prevented under all conditions.

#### Real-time Update Testing
- **WebSocket Connection Stability:** Test connection resilience under various network conditions
- **Event Delivery Reliability:** Verify all events delivered with correct data
- **Performance Under Load:** Test real-time updates with high event volume
- **Reconnection Handling:** Validate automatic reconnection after disconnection

#### State Management Testing
- **Cross-Session Persistence:** Verify state retention across bot restarts
- **Concurrent User Handling:** Test state management with multiple simultaneous users
- **State Corruption Prevention:** Validate data integrity under failure conditions
- **Conflict Resolution:** Test concurrent state modification scenarios

### Performance Testing Requirements

#### Load Testing Specifications
**Testing Configuration:** Comprehensive load testing to validate system performance under realistic usage conditions

**Concurrent User Testing:** Testing with 1000+ concurrent users over 30-minute duration with 5-minute ramp-up time to simulate realistic user adoption patterns. The testing validates system stability, response times, and resource utilization under sustained load.

**Scenario-Based Testing:** Multiple testing scenarios with different operation weights to simulate realistic usage patterns:
- **Basic Command Execution (40% weight):** Authentication, status checks, and help commands representing routine user interactions
- **Campaign Management (30% weight):** Campaign creation, execution, and monitoring representing core platform functionality
- **Real-time Updates (20% weight):** WebSocket subscription and event processing representing real-time system capabilities
- **Advanced Operations (10% weight):** Analytics, reporting, and optimization representing power user functionality

**Performance Validation:** Testing validates response time targets, throughput requirements, and system stability under various load conditions. It includes memory usage monitoring, CPU utilization tracking, and database performance analysis.

#### Reliability Testing
- **99.9% Uptime Requirement:** System availability under normal conditions
- **Graceful Degradation Validation:** Functionality during service outages
- **Recovery Time Measurement:** Time to restore full functionality after failures
- **Data Consistency Verification:** Data integrity during failure scenarios
