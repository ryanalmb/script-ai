## Risk Mitigation Framework

### 1. Technical Safeguards

#### Rate Limiting and Throttling
```typescript
class SmartRateLimiter {
  private async checkAndWait(accountId: string, action: string): Promise<void> {
    const key = `${accountId}:${action}`;
    const current = await redis.get(key) || 0;
    const limit = this.getLimitForAction(action);
    
    if (current >= limit) {
      const waitTime = this.calculateWaitTime(action);
      await this.sleep(waitTime);
    }
    
    await redis.incr(key);
    await redis.expire(key, this.getWindowSize(action));
  }
}
```

#### Content Filtering
```typescript
class ContentFilter {
  async checkCompliance(content: string): Promise<ComplianceResult> {
    const checks = [
      this.checkProfanity(content),
